PREFACE. vii

In the diligent discharge of his duty as a teacher, with the occasional
disti-action of composing some little treatise to raise his reputation in thc
world or gain favour with a patron, our author's life at Kinloss must have
passed away peacefully and pleasantly‚ notwithstanding the little dispute
which he dignifics somewhat too much in recording it.(¹) His posthumous
fortune has not been so enviable‚ since he has drawn down upon him the
indignation of Lord Hailes by two unlucky blunders which chanced to
cross his Lordship in his most earnest investigations. The first was the
1·epetiti0n('2) of the foolish legend of St. David sending his messengers
to collect the laws of foreign states, and from these compiling the Reyiam
Alajestatem. The other, if possible a more heinous offence in Lord
Hailes's estimation, consisted in rashly asserting that Adam Gordon ’
was created Earl of Sutherland, instead of becomz'ny Earl in right of his
wife, Elizabeth‚ the Countess. For both of these transgressions he is
subjected to severe chastisement3(3) and the latter brings under Lord
Hailes's censure the present work :—“ Had they looked,'' says his Lord-
ship, ‘⁶ into his account of the Abbots of Kinloss, they would have per—
ceived how mean his abilities were, and how contemptible his station.''(⁴)

It is indeed difficult to imagine any thing more imperfect and inaccu-
rate than the early part of the following w0rk; but if the fable of the
Reyz'mn, and the mistake about the Earldom of Sutherland, had not roused
Lord Hailes to more than usual indignation, he would not have censured
so severely a work which the author had not finished, and of the unavoid-
able imperfectioris of which he speaks in a tone to deprecate c1·iticism.(⁵)
Our author’s materials were evidently very defective, and seem to have

consisted of little more than the nzarfyroloqiunz, or obituary, recording the
