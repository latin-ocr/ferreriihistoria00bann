main, however, of his endeavours to obtain more accurate information from
other sources,(¹) and he oocasionally quotes an ancient charter with an
exactness which shows that he had it before him while he wrote.(2)

The MS. which has been mostly followed, is that preserved in the
Advocates Library at Edinburgl1.(3) It is evidently contemporary, and
probably written either in the author's own hand, or by one of his pupils
at Kinloss. It has quite the appearance of a note-book, in which heads
and names of Abbots were entered, to be filled up as information should
offer. Numerous blanks remain, and these pages have, in some instances,
been used for writing exercises in Latin, probably by the pupils of Ferrerius.

Another, and probably a later manuscript of this work, said to be in
the handwriting of the autho1·,(⁴) is preserved among the Queen of Sweden’s
MSS. in the V atiean.(⁵) From it, that part of the work has been printed
which is published by Mal-tene‚(⁶) who has omitted the full life of Abbot
Thomas Chrystall.

Bishop Nieholson mentions that Dr. John J arneson had transcribed the
Vatican MS„ “ and kiudly communicated it to several of his learned
count.1·ymen.”<⁷) One of these undoubtedly was the industrious Wodrow,
and tho transoript made by his own hand, is now in the Library of the

University of Glasgow. It has been collated .for the present edition.

A few dates collected from authentio sources, may serve to correct

some of the inaecuracies of Ferrerius.
