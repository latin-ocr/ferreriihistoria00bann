vi PREFACE.

In 1540, lze was again induced to come to Scotland by the earnest
entreaties of his patron, who in that year was raised to the Bishoprick of
Orkney, but, still holding the Abbey of Kinloss with the priory of Bean-
lieu in commendam, he again placed Ferrerius at Kinloss, who renewed his
instructions to the monks of that Abbey, along with some monks of
Beaulieu, placed there to have the benefit of his tuition.

Four years later, we find him again preparing to quit Scotland, teri-ified
or disgusted by the violence of reformation which then rendered Scotland
no pleasant residence for the inmate of a cloister. He was still alive
at the date of the rental annexed to this volume, since we find there
charged against the Abbey, his pension of 5340, which, he informs us, was
settled upon him by his patron Abbot Robert Reid, on his second coming
to Scotland. He probably spent the latter years of his life at Paris,
where his edition of Boece's History, with a wretched supplement by
himself, was published in 1574.

Of the life and character of our author, we know scarcely anything.

-That hc was diligent in the discharge of his duty is proved not more by
the long muster-roll of the works which he read and expounded to his
pupils than by the continued trust reposed in him by a person so accom-
plishcd and so zealous in the cause of learning as Robert Reid, Bishop
of Orkney.

His learning and scholarship, of which he himself was plainly well
satisfied, were, no doubt, considerable, as compared with the average
acquirements of tho monks of Kinloss3 but the works he has left do
not impress us with so high an opinion of his abilities or judgment, as of
his industry and his love of writing. It will be observed that he made his
prelections not from the original language of the works of Aristotle and
the other Greek authors whom he expounded, but was content to use a

Latin version.
