Some light has already 119911 thrown upon the early endowments ol' 1119
Abbcy of Kinloss by a few oharters printed with the Chartulary of Moray.
A chal-ter of Strathyhz, by william 1110 Lion‚ is also annexed to 1119 present
volume. It has been printed from an old copy preserved in the Rccord
of Deeds(¹) in the General chister Ilouse, collated with a copy in Shaw's
History of Moray, which seems to have been printed from the original
Chai-ter.

The Rental of the Abbey, which is given in the Appendix, 18 taken
from the Register of the Assumption of Benefices—a valuation made in
1562 and the following years, for regulatiug the third of the greater bene-
fices to be paid to the reformed Clergy and to the Crown. This particular
account would seem from a date which immediately follows it, to have
been rendered in 1574, but may have 119911 earlier. It would appear not
to have been in all respects satisfactory. After a short valuation of the
Priory of Beauheu, then held in commendam with Kinloss, the Register
has the following note :—“ Remember my Lord Comptrollare to speir 1119
rontall of thir tua, Kynlos and Bewlie, 1191111, for thay ar suspitious nuent
the fischingiS.”

Hector Boece, who, Ferrerius tells us,('2) attendes] Abbot Thomas Chry-
stall during his last illness, describes Kinloss in his time in 1911118 which
savour of his usual ekaggeration‚—“ Nune ibi coenobz‘um est cum (tzqqzcstissimo
templo dz'voe 11119ῖηί sacro, cedibusque mqqnificoe strueturce piorum emta Cis-
lerciensis instituti inszyne, nulli in Albione 7·elz]qz'onis observatione secundmu.”
Unfortunately we have no more particular account of the Abbey buildings
than what is afforded by Ferrerius. On the margin of one of the pagos

of tho Edinburgh MS. is this note:
OEhc &remu uf mulus fell the fpft ham* . . . . 1571..
