he accompanied King J ames into England, obtained the office of Master

of the Rolls‚ and was 3 person of influenee at court, and of great wealth.(¹)

(¹) In the Library at Auchinleck is 3 “ par-
ticular inventorie of the movabilis, houshald
stuf, plait, and pleneising,'' of his house ut the
time of his departure for England, drawn up
in 1610. It is curious to think that the scyphi,
the calices, and the pk ialae, the pride of many an
old abbot of Kinloss, may figure as the basius,
lavers, and flagons of the inventory of the lay
Lord,· whilethe“ Tourkey carpets''and“ Irische
