contributions levied on the Abbey by the English during the dominion of
Edward L, he should have met with no record of the residence of the
English Monarch himself in the Abbey, where he remained from the QOth
September to the loth October 1303.

An inroad of his grandson is less known. The romantio expedition of
Edward ΙΙΙ. 111 1336, to relieve the young Countess of Athon, who had
been besieged during the whole winter in the Castle of Lochindorb, is so
remarkable that it has been judged allowable to subjoin to this preface
a minute and curious account of it contained in a contemporary letter 30)
although the only connexion with the subject of the present volume arises
from Kinloss having been the extreme point of the expedition of the third
Edward, as it seems to have been of the more formidable invasion of
Edward I.

Of the Abbots during the remainder of the 14th Century, we have 110
memorials. With the commencement of the l5th, may be said to begin
the authentic and positive history of Ferrerius. From thence his names
and dates are precise and consistent with chronology.

Our author's patron, the excellent Bishop Robert Reid, held the Ab·
bacy of Kinloss till his death in 1558.

He was succeeded by &Valter Hetton‚ a monk and cantor of the Abbey‚
who is mentioned by our auum-(2) as having been sent by Abbot Thomas
to be educated with the Friars Preachers of Aberdeen. He occurs as

Abbot of Kinloss in many writs from 1559 till 1574. He held the priory
of Beaulieu along with Kinloss.

After the Suppression of Religious Houses, the Abbacy of Kinloss was
confer-red upon Edward Bmce, a lawyer‚ descended of the family of
Clacmanan, and the founder of the noble houses of Elgin and Aylesbury.

In 1608, ho had a charter of the Abbey lands erected into a tempora!
